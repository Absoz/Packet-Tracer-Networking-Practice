# Packet-Tracer-Networking-Practice
I have an associates in Networking and Virtualization, and received a couple years of cisco training during the course of achieving that degree.

Refreshing my networking knowledge and practicing my networking skills by creating scenarios in packet tracer and working through them.
Figured this might also be a good way to display my networking skills.

To view the files, you'll need packet tracer. Download it at: https://skillsforall.com/resources/lab-downloads
You'll need a cisco account, but you don't have to pay or register for any trainings to download it. 

Alternatively, I would be happy to present this to you using my device in the context of a job interview.

Feel free to reach out!
